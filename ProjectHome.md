This project was built with the following objectives in mind:

  1. Project documentation should be in plain text files, which would be placed under svn control
  1. It should be possible to build static html files with DocBook-like navigation menu to place them on the website, or to zip and offer them for download
  1. To export docs to CHM file
  1. It should be possible to highlight the code in your documentation
  1. No external XSLT processor or other tools should be used -- just PHP 5.2+
  1. Index page should be built by using page's keywords
  1. Web-interface for just-in-place edit should be provided
