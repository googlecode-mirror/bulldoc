<p>The ability to edit and view your book without full project compilation and to make correction right in web-browser make life much easier.</p>

<h3>Book's content</h3>
<p>When you view page, under the page's title you can see the "edit" link. Click and make corrections right here!</p>

<p>Press "edit TOC" in the upper top corner to edit book's structure. You can edit TOC file &mdash; add, change and delete pages and chapters. But the system doesn't clear the garbage, i.e. you should take care of files with text and images deletion by yourself.</p>

<h3>Bookshelf</h3>

<p>
There are two tools in bookshelf section: bookshelf edit and new book creation.
</p>

<p>
In book creation form there is only one mandatory field: <b>keyword</b>,  the books ID on the bookshelf. Other fields match bookshelf options (<bdc:link page='content/bookshelf.html'/>) and book's options mentioned in <span class='filepath'>book_data.yml</span>.
</p>

<p>
If there are <span class='filepath'>cover.png</span> or <span class='filepath'>cover.jpg</span> file in the root folder of your book, then the image will be used as book's cover on the bookshelf.
